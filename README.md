# SLiM-code
The script options here are the stepping stones for my overall project to be able to simulate oncogenesis, the first goal was to recreate a case study patient with clonal hematopoiesis
For beginners to SLiM, I'd highly recommend visiting the messerlab.org website and downloading the SLiM manual. 
SLiM download is also avaliable on the messerlab.org website 
Key: 
NM: Non-mutant
M: Mutant 
NWF: non wright-fischer
WF: Wright-fischer 

*** Tip for python when doing a newick conversion 
in order for python to be able to run a conversion of the tree file make your the following add-ons are downloaded:
- homebrew
- pip 
- pyslim
- tskit
  
All are open source on the web

*** You cannot add mutations to a individual >0 year old in a non WF simulation 

*** For clarity in my final phylogenies many simulation scripts show mutation rate at a rate of 0, this is intentional and does not effect any new mutations added to the population in later generations 

happy simulating :)
